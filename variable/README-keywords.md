Ruby has numerous keywords—predefined, reserved terms associated with specific programming tasks and contexts. Keywords include def (for method definitions), class (for class definitions), if (conditional execution), and __FILE__ (the name of the file currently being executed). There are about 40 of them, and they’re generally
