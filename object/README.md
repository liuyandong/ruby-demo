In Ruby, everything is an object. This means that all data types in Ruby, such as strings, integers, arrays, and even classes, are instances of objects.

An object in Ruby is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of the objects that will be created from it.

When you create an object in Ruby, you are creating an instance of a class. The object has its own set of properties and methods that are defined by its class. For example, if you create a string object in Ruby, it will have properties such as its length, and methods such as upcase and reverse.

You can also create your own classes in Ruby and define your own properties and methods for the objects created from those classes. This is one of the powerful features of Ruby, as it allows you to create custom data types and functionality specific to your application's needs.

In summary, Ruby objects are instances of classes that represent data and functionality in your program.
